# Layout âœ¨

Here you can find some of my little projects with HTML and CSS.

ðŸ“ŒThe 'alien-blog': ðŸ‘¾
I applied HTML basics such as commonly used elements and how to create a web page, how to add elements such as links, headers and images.
Then I implemented CSS basics, such as importing styles into an HTML file, how to target specific elements on a page using selectors, useful tools, how to add space to a page, and some ways to create basic layouts. All this was applied in the small blog that I present.

ðŸ“ŒMy 'alien-form': ðŸ‘¾
Briefly, I created forms using HTML and CSS, handled form submission, issues, and styling.

ðŸ“ŒMy profile:
I learnt the basics of CSS by building my website, learning modern techniques and good practices.
